          <h1>Lego Storage Unit</h1>
          <p>Living on a budget in a small apartment? Don't worry the Lego Storage unit is perfect for you. Initially inspired by a child favorite toy the Lego Storage unit was created to be lightweight, cheap and accessible. The Lego boxes will be able to lock into each other similar to a Lego piece, allowing users the freedom to customize their orientation.
<br><br>
With the heavy-duty version of the unit it can easily be incorporated into our user’s furniture, specifically as a bed frame or legs for a desk. The boxes can be organized to a person’s comfort level on whether they would want to stack the boxes high or low based on their accessibility needs. It can also be used as temporary stairs for hard to reach places. Its important to note that the box will still be light enough that moving it around won’t require much effort.
<br><br>

The thought behind the design is that the possibilities for the use of this box would be endless as the user will be able to tailor the lego unit according to their needs at any time and anywhere. This unit will be created using a 3D printer and all the materials were selectively chosen because they were eco friendly.</p>
          <h2>My Angle</h2>
          <p>For this project I was in charge of creating the to-scale physical prototype, we had created a smaller version with the 3D printer but had decided that it would be much to time consuming to print out a 30cm x 30cm structure, therefore I  created one out of foam-core.</p>
