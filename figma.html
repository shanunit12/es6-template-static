          <h1 class="fh">Figma Redesign</h1>
          <p class="fp">For this project my group and I were given the opportunity to redesign an existing application. We had decided to focus on the collaborative website called Figma.
<br><br>
When evaluating Figma the main thing we noticed was the lack of collaboration tools available. Other applications like google provided users with the opportunity to make documents, calendars and slides together. But before we could begin adding features we needed to first conduct research on articles and journals that discuss key tools and values that make collaboration successful as well as interview some users.


<br><br>
The most important thing we were able to gather from our users was that in order to officially collaborate a team must use several applications at once specifically a messenger of video chat app, the actual collaboration app whether it be google docs or Figma, an app to set reminders and timelines etc. For a student trying to do this all on one computer screen can become very taxing, which is why most decided to buy additional monitors or devices. However, most students are on a budget and can't afford to make those kinds of purchases, this is why we decided to incorporate more features into Figma that would help to reduce the need to use additional devices.<br><br>
          This project required 3 iterations along with a wizard test, a usability test and a heuristic evaluation.</p>
          <h2 class="fh">My Angle</h2>
          <p class="fp"> For this project I was incharge of creating the mockups and clickable prototypes. As my group and I would have students test out our prototypes, appropriate changes would later be made to reflect the results of the user test. For the mockups I used illustrator to create them, and for the cliackable prototypes I used Adobe XD. I also developed the final persona and empathy map from the results my team had aquired through user testing.</p>
