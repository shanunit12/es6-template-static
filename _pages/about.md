# About Me
<hr>
<br>


Hello my name is Shannon Halycz. I'm a Paris  based UI / UX Designer and Web Developer, who is currently enrolled in Wilfrid Laurier’s User Experience Design (BDes) program.
<br> <br>
As a kid I liked to draw and paint, so when I started high school I decided to explore digital media and photography. I immediately fell in love and knew a media related career was in my future. When I finally graduated high school I wasn't sure what media field I wanted to specialize in, so I enrolled in Humber colleges Multimedia Design and Development program. Through this program I was able to explore multiple media disciplines like Video, Web Development and Graphic Design. Once I had graduated from Humber’s program I finally decided that I wanted to specialize in User Experience Design, so I enrolled into Wilfrid Laurier. I also love to learn and take on new challenges.
