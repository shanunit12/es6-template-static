          <h1>MYLS Redesign</h1>
          <p>MYLS can be confusing and over-cluttered with useless features. This is why my team had decided to redesign the application to make is more efficient and useful for students.
<br><br>
When we were originally tasked with this project our main goal was to see if students were struggling with their second year, however it turned out that the students we interviewed felt the exact different, they had really enjoyed year 2. This is why we changed our focus and looked towards MYLS. Through most of our interviews we discovered that a lot of students relied on each other for on campus information and study tips
<br><br>
This is how we got inspired to create a discussion thread within MYLS where students could easily access each other to ask questions, leave advice and make general comments. We also attempted to make improvement on existing pages like Academic Advising to provide students with more useful resources at the touch of a finger</p>
          <h2>My Angle</h2>
          <p>For this project I was incharge of creating the mockups and clickable prototypes. As my group and I would have students test out our prototypes, appropriate changes would later be made to reflect the results of the user test. For the mockups I used illustrator to create them, and for the cliackable prototypes I used Adobe XD. I was the one to also come up wih the initial idea for a student message thread on MYLS because in my own personal experience talking to other students is generally how you learn the most about your campus, events going on and student survival tips.</p>
